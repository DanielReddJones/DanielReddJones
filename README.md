<center><h1>Hi, Iâ€™m @DanielReddJones!</h1></center>

<ul>
<li> <b>My interests:</b> Iâ€™m interested in programming, Linux, and classical literature. I grew up on LOGO, learned C++, Java, and Python in college, and am now working to get familiar with low level programming techniques. In my personal life, I am trying to read all of the great works of literature that influenced our culture. My current project was inspired by my love of literature. I hope to one day write a program that will help literature become more accessible to those in need.</li> 

<li> <b>What I am learning right now:</b> Rust, low level C, and x86 assembly. I am deeply interested in low level programming and am trying to get a deeper understanding of it.</li>

<li> <b>What I am working on:</b> Right now I am working on Bibliofile. A command-line ebook reader. </li>
