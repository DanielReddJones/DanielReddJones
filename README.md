<center><h1>Hi, Iâ€™m @DanielReddJones!</h1></center>

<ul>
<li> <b>My interests:</b> Iâ€™m interested in programming, Linux, and classical literature. I grew up on LOGO, learned C++, Java, and Python in college, and am now working to get familiar with more modern technologies. In my personal life, I am trying to read all of the great works of literature that influenced our culture. At the moment I am reading Dune, and soon will be picking up the Canterbury Tales when I am finished with Frank Herbert's classic.</li> 

<li> <b>What I am learning right now:</b> I am currently trying to learn older languages such as C. When I get comfortable with using C often, I will switch my focus to x86 assembly. Its old, but nerdy! </li>

<li> <b>What I am working on:</b> Right now I am working on June Editor. My version of the Kilo Editor tutorial project. </li>

<li> <b>How to reach me:</b> danielreddjones@gmail.com </li>
