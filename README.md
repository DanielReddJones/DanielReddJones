<center><h1>Hi, I’m @DanielReddJones!</h1></center>

<ul>
<li> <b>My interests:</b> I’m interested in programming, Linux, and classical literature. I grew up on LOGO, learned C++, Java, and Python in college, and am now working to get familiar with more modern technologies. In my personal life, I am trying to read all of the great works of literature that influenced our culture. At the moment I am reading Dune, and soon will be picking up the Canterbury Tales when I am finished with Frank Herbert's classic.</li> 

<li> <b>What I am learning right now:</b> I’m currently learning Kotlin for Android Studio. I believe that mobile apps are the future, as people want their devices everywhere they go. As well, there are constant innovations in the mobile electronics market which make it continually relavent. I also want to learn Electron because it is cross-platform. I believe that cross-platform apps are the future of desktop computing, as it makes programs OS-agnostic and allows people to serve their apps to as many customers as possible. </li>

<li> <b>What I am working on:</b> Right now I am trying to complete 10 projects by the end of 2023. </li>
