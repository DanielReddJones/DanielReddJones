<center><h1>Hi, Iâ€™m @DanielReddJones!</h1></center>

<ul>
<li> <b>My interests:</b> Iâ€™m interested in programming, Linux, and classical literature. I grew up on LOGO, learned C++, Java, and Python in college, and am now working to get familiar with more modern technologies. In my personal life, I am trying to read all of the great works of literature that influenced our culture. At the moment I am reading Dune, and soon will be picking up the Canterbury Tales when I am finished with Frank Herbert's classic.</li> 

<li> <b>What I am learning right now:</b> Many things! I am taking the AWS Practitioner exam on April 7th 2023, and the RHCSA V8 on May 4th 2023. Also I am making tools in Rust for personal use, so I can also count using Rust as a skill I am learning. </li>

<li> <b>What I am working on:</b> Right now I am working on Bibliofile. A command-line ebook reader. </li>
